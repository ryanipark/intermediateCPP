# Intermediate Programming in C++
In depth descriptions of each program:
  
## 01. Sorting
  Three simple programs that implements the use of Bubble sort, selection sort, and Insertion sort. The program reads input from a file, sorts them and prints them in a simply formatted fashion. 
## 02. Recursion
  Two programs that implement the use of recursion to solve very basic problems, towers of hanoi and Eight queens.
## 03. Sorting Plus
  These two programs implement Merge sort and Quick sort, reading input from a file and outputting the result of sorting in a formatted fashion.
## 04. Simple Simulator computer
  This program simulated more of the basic lower level machine language programming. It would have options for input/output, storing/loading with storage, and basic arithmitic/control operations.

## 05. Object oriented bookstore
  Program that simulates a small inventory of books in a store. It stores ISBN, author, book title, amount in stock, and price. It has the ability search for books, processing them in an order and decrimenting inventory, showing information of orders processed.
## 06. Operation Overloading using Matrices
  Simple program to implement operation overloading in a fully implemented matrix class allowing for several types of arithmitic and comparison to be done.
## 07. Infix and Postfix using a stack
  This program involved implementing my own stack class, using it to turn an infix string to postfix output and displaying it to a user.
## 08. Infix and Postfix evaluation
  Piggy back of the previous 07 program, it uses the postfix string to do arithmitic in order from left to right printing the final value to display to the user.
## 09. Template Double Linked List
  This program is simply made to test a template doubly linked list class that I implemented.
## 10. Btree
  Another simple program to test my implementation a Btree as a template class.
## 11. Inheritance
  A simple program that utilizes object oriented inheritance, using shape as the base class. This is also a program where I first utilized and tested polymorphism.
